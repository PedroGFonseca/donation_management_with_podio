# Documentation and code for Podio Donation Management

## Context 
Donation management for a non-profit has a number of challenges with tracking money, needs, stakeholders and evidence. This project aims to do 2 things: 
1. Contain clear and intuitive instructions as to how to setup donation management in Podio 
2. Contain code for optimizing basic tasks related to donation management with Podio 

It tries to stay agnostic to the organization, however a number of choices made are related to needs of one particular foundation. 

The project follows Documentation Driven Development, so the documentation can be ahead of code at any time.
