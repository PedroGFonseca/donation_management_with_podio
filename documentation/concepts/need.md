# Need

## What It Is
An individual-level funding requirement for a specific recipient with a precise amount, representing the atomic unit of funding accountability within the foundation system.

## Purpose
To provide granular tracking of individual funding requirements while maintaining perfect accountability for every recipient and amount within group requests or individual applications.

## Why it is needed 
The Need entity solves the granularity dilemma by enabling both clean UI management (through NeedPackages) and detailed individual accountability. It ensures every recipient and amount is precisely tracked while supporting the new Allocation-based funding model that replaces problematic direct Needâ†”Transaction relationships.

## Key Relationships
- Parent: NeedPackage (the group request that contains this individual need)
- Children: None (atomic unit)
- Links to: Allocation records (explicit funding assignments), Person/School/Group (the specific recipient), NeedTemplate (if generated from template)
