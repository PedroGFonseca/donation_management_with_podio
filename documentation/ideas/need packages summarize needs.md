**Need Type Auto-Summary for NeedPackage**

The system would automatically calculate and display a breakdown of need types within each NeedPackage, such as:

- **Type Distribution**: "Transport: 25 needs (83%), Education: 5 needs (17%)"
- **Amount Breakdown**: "Transport: 125,000 KES, Education: 25,000 KES" 
- **Status by Type**: "Transport: 20 paid/5 pending, Education: 3 paid/2 pending"

This would help users quickly understand the composition of group requests without manually counting individual needs, and support reporting questions like "How much of this package went to transport vs education?" The summary would update automatically as individual needs are added, modified, or their statuses change.

**Benefits**: Instant visibility into package composition, better budgeting insights, simplified reporting for donors or compliance.
